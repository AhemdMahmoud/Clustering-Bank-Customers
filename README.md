 ## ü§≥ The primary objective of this project is to:
 ## 1: `Employ` advanced unsupervised learning techniques to categorize customers based on their banking behavior.
 ##2: `Determine` the optimal number of clusters using methods such as the Elbow method, Silhouette score, statistical gap analysis, and hierarchical clustering, and some other techniques.
## 3: `Validate` clustering results and explore dependencies among clusters using ANOVA tests.
## 4: `Visualize` each step of the process using t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for enhanced understanding and interpretation.

# üåü Business Understanding:
